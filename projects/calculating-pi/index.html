    <p>This method uses random probability and geometry to calculate π<br><br>
        We start with a square $C$ of side length $s$.<br>
        Within $C$ lets choose a subsection $B$<br>
        Lets also choose $x$ and $y$ from the set $[0,s]$, and have $v = (x,y)$<br>
        Then the probability that $v$ falls in $B$ is as follows:<br>
        $$P({v\;in\;B}) = \frac{Area_{B}}{Area_{C}} = \frac{Area_{B}}{s^2}$$
        If we choose $B$ to be to the circle inscribed in $C$, the probability that $v$ is in $B$ is $\frac{π}{4}$.<br>
        $$P({v\;in\;B}) = \frac{Area_{B}}{s^2} = \frac{\frac{πs^2}{4}}{s^2} = \frac{π}{4}$$
        This means if we choose $n$ random points within $C$, the number of points, $n'$, that fall within $B$ will
        approximately be $\frac{πn}{4}$.<br>
        With this, we can approximate π:<br>
        $$n'\cdot\frac{4}{n}\approxπ$$
